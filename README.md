I tried to present the commands that i use everyday:
- amend
- rebase
- rebase --interative
- squash commits
- fixup commit
- autsquash commits
- reset (soft and hard)
- reflog
- what is a conflict and how to resolve it
- create a PR and review your mates code

It was an interactive session done by Mahdi Cheikhrouhou and me, we tried to simulate a true use case by reviewing each other code, creating conflicts and recolving them live...
